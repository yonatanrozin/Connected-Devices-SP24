# Connected-Devices-SP24

This repo contains weekly code samples from the Connected Devices course of Spring 2024. 

To get the files onto your own computer:
- In a command line interface (terminal or powershell):
  - Use ```cd``` to change your working directory to the location in which you want to save the files
- On this GitHub window, click the green ```<> Code``` button and copy the HTTPS url
- Back in the command line interface:
  - ```git clone <paste HTTPS url>``` to get a copy of the repository at your current working directory
- __Be sure not to change any files inside your cloned repository! If you want to make changes, copy any files into a different folder on your own computer!__

Once the files have been downloaded, to get future changes:
- In a command line interface:
  - ```cd``` into the directory folder. This isn't the folder you saved the repository to in the steps above! Make sure it's the repository folder itself!
  - ```git pull``` to get the latest changes
  - These steps will only work if you haven't made any changes to the repository files. If you have:
    - ```git reset --hard``` will update your files to the latest repository files, __replacing any changes you've made to it!__ Be sure to backup your changes to a different location first if you wish to keep them!
